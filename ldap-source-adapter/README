This is an ldap source adapter for grouper using the ldap library from Virginia Tech
(http://code.google.com/p/vt-middleware/wiki/vtldap)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use sasl external auth with certificates exclusively, and I can't test 
anything else.  Should work with principal+password.
We also use PEM certs and keys.  Should work OK with plain old java keystore
and the various command line settings that go with it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


build with 

 # ant jar

builds dist/ldap-source-adapter.jar

copy that to your grouper's lib/custom  directory

You might also need in grouper's lib/custom thesei jars:  (all should be found in ./lib)

   ( newer versions are probably OK.  these can be found in ./lib/  )

   bcprov-ext-jdk16-141.jar 
   bcprov-jdk16-141.jar
   commons-pool-1.2.jar   (used for logging.  grouper also uses some of these, so maybe already there )
   vt-ldap-3.3.2.jar      (VT's library, http://code.google.com/p/vt-middleware/downloads/list)
   
to configure use the sample.sources.xml and sample.ldap.properties as guides.


The adapter provides a last name, first name search to cut down on the responses 
when looking for, say, somebody named johnson. 
In the search field you can specify:  "last_name, first_name"
and use asterisk as a wild card, e.g.  "johnson, a*"

see the sample to configure last and first.
